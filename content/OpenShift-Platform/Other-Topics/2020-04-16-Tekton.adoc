_OpenShift Pipelines is a cloud-native, continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) solution for building pipelines using Tekton. Tekton is a flexible, Kubernetes-native, open-source CI/CD framework that enables automating deployments across multiple platforms (Kubernetes, serverless, VMs, etc) by abstracting away the underlying details._ [<<source_1,1>>]

== OpenShift Pipelines features

_Source: [<<source_1,1>>]_

* Standard CI/CD pipeline definition based on Tekton
* Build images with Kubernetes tools such as S2I, Buildah, Buildpacks, Kaniko, etc
* Deploy applications to multiple platforms such as Kubernetes, serverless and VMs
* Easy to extend and integrate with existing tools
* Scale pipelines on-demand
* Portable across any Kubernetes platform
* Designed for microservices and decentralized teams
* Integrated with the OpenShift Developer Console 

== Prerequisites

. OpenShift 4.x cluster.  Try yourself at https://try.openshift.com
. *Optional*: https://github.com/tektoncd/cli#installing-tkn[Tekton CLI^] - Optional for now, since you could do everything via UI as well.
. oc/kubectl CLI or WebUI

NOTE: The Tekton CLI is optional in case you prefer to do everything via the OpenShift WebUI. However, below examples make use of the Tekton CLI and I personally would recommend to at least install it. (Like oc client it is good to have a CLI option as well). In any case, all described action can be done directly via the WebUI as well. 

== Basic Concepts

Tekton makes use of several custom resources (CRD). 

These CRDs are:

. [black silver-background]#Task#: each step in a pipeline is a task, while a task can contain several steps itself, which are required to perform a specific task. For each Task a pod will be allocated and for each step inside this Task a container will be used. This helps in better scalability and better performance throughout the pipeline process.
. [black silver-background]#Pipeline#: is a series of tasks, combined to work together in a defined (structured) way
. [black silver-background]#TaskRun#: is the result of a Task, all combined TaskRuns are used in the PipelineRun 
. [black silver-background]#PipelineRun#: is the actual execution of a whole Pipeline, containing the results of the pipeline (success, failed...)

Pipelines and Tasks should be generic and never define possible variables, like input git repository, directly in their definition. For this, the concept of PipelineResources has been created, which defines these parameters and which are used during a PipelineRun.

== Installation
The *OpenShift Pipeline* is an operator which can e installed using the following yaml:

[source,yaml]
----
cat <<'EOF' > deploy-OpenShift-Pipelines.yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: openshift-pipelines-operator
  namespace: openshift-operators
spec:
  channel: dev-preview
  name: openshift-pipelines-operator
  source: community-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
EOF
----

[source,bash]
----
oc create -f deploy-OpenShift-Pipelines.yaml
----

As an alternative, you can also use the WebUI to rollout the operator:

. Search for "OpenShift Pipeline" under OperatorHub and install it
. Select:
.. All Namespaces: since the operator needs to watch for Tekton Custom Resources across all namespaces.
.. Channel: Dev Preview
.. Approve Strategy: Automatic


== Prepare a tutorial project

To test our OpenShift Pipelines, we need to deploy an example application. This application let's you vote what pet you like more: Cats or Dogs? It contais of a backend and a frontend part, which both will be deployed in a namespace. 

Let's first create a new project:

[source,bash]
----
oc new-project pipelines-tutorial
----

The OpenShift Pipeline operator will automatically create a _pipeline_ serviceaccount with all required permissions to build and push an image and which is used by PipelineRuns:

[source,bash]
----
oc get sa pipeline
NAME       SECRETS   AGE
pipeline   2         15s
----

'''

== Create a Task

A Task is the smallest block of a Pipeline which by itself can contain one or more steps which are executed in order to process a specific element. For each Task a pod is allocated and each step is running in a container inside this pod. Tasks are reusable by other Pipelines. _Input_ and _Output_ specifications can be used to interact with other Tasks.

Let's create two tasks https://github.com/openshift/pipelines-tutorial/blob/master/01_pipeline[Source: Pipeline-Tutorial^]

[source,yaml]
----
cat <<'EOF' > deploy-Example-Tasks.yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Task

    - name: apply
      image: quay.io/openshift/origin-cli:latest
      workingDir: /workspace/source
      command: ["/bin/bash", "-c"]
      args:
        - |-
          echo Applying manifests in $(inputs.params.manifest_dir) directory
          oc apply -f $(inputs.params.manifest_dir)
          echo -----------------------------------
---
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1

    resources:
      - {type: image, name: image}
    params:
      - name: deployment
        description: The name of the deployment patch the image
        type: string
  steps:
    - name: patch
      image: quay.io/openshift/origin-cli:latest
      command: ["/bin/bash", "-c"]
      args:
        - |-
          oc patch deployment $(inputs.params.deployment) --patch='{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{
            "containers":[{
              "name": "$(inputs.params.deployment)",
              "image":"$(inputs.resources.image.url)"
            }]
          }}}}'
EOF
----

[source,bash]
----
oc create -f deploy-Example-Tasks.yaml
----

Verify that the two tasks have been created using the Tekton CLI:

[source,bash]
----
tkn task ls

NAME                AGE
apply-manifests     52 seconds ago
update-deployment   52 seconds ago

== Create a Pipeline
A pipeline is a set of Tasks, which should be executed in a defined way to achieve a specific goal. 

The example Pipeline below uses two resources:

- git-repo: defines the Git-Source
- image: Defines the target at a repository  

It first uses the Task *buildah*, which is a standard Task the OpenShift operator created automatically. This task will build the image. The resulted image is pushed to an image registry, defined in the *output* parameter. After that our created tasks *apply-manifest* and *update-deployment* are executed. The execution order of these tasks is defined with the *runAfter* Parameter in the yaml definition. 

NOTE: The Pipeline should be re-usable accross multiple projects or environments, thats why the resources (git-repo and image) are not defined here. When a Pipeline is executed, these resources will get defined.

== Trigger Pipeline

After the Pipeline has been created, it can be triggered to execute the Tasks. 

=== Create PipelineResources
Since the Pipeline is generic, we need to define 2 *PipelineResources* first, to execute a Pipepline. 
Our example application contains a frontend (vote-ui) AND a backend (vote-api), therefore 4 PipelineResources will be created. (2 times git repository to clone the source and 2 time output image)

Quick overview:

* ui-repo: will be used as _git_repo_ in the Pipepline for the Frontend
* ui-image: will be used as _image_ in the Pipeline for the Frontend
* api-repo: will be used as _git_repo_ in the Pipepline for the Backend
* api-image: will be used as _image_ in the Pipeline for the Backend

The resources can be listed with:

[source,bash]

=== Execute Pipelines
We start a PipelineRune for the backend and frontend of our application. 

[source,yaml]

  - name: image
    resourceRef:
      name: ui-image
  params:
  - name: deployment-name
    value: vote-ui
EOF
----

[source,bash]
----
oc create -f deploy-Example-PipelineRun.yaml
----

The PipelineRuns can be listed with

[source,bash]
----
tkn pipelinerun ls

NAME                           STARTED         DURATION   STATUS
build-deploy-api-pipelinerun   3 minutes ago   ---        Running
build-deploy-ui-pipelinerun    3 minutes ago   ---        Running
----

Moreover, the logs can be viewed with the following command and select the appropriate PipelineRun:

[source,bash]
----
tkn pipeline logs -f
? Select pipelinerun:  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
> build-deploy-api-pipelinerun started 2 minutes ago
  build-deploy-ui-pipelinerun started 2 minutes ago
----

=== Checking your application

Now our Pipeline built and deployed the voting application, where you can vote if you prefere cats or dogs (Cats or course :) )

Get the route of your project and open the URL in the browser. (Should be something like vote-ui-pipelines-tutorial.apps.yourclustername)

== OpenShift WebUI 

With the OpenShift Pipeline operator a new menu item is introduced on the WebUI of OpenShift. All Tekton CLI command which are used above, can actually be replaced with the web interface, in case you prefere this. The big advantage is th graphical presentation of Pipelines and their lifetime.

I will not create screenshots for every screen, but for example pipelines: 

Under _Pipelines_ a list of pipelines will be shown.
