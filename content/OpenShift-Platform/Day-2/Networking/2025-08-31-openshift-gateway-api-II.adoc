This is our second look into the Kubernetes Gateway API an it's
integration into OpenShift. This post covers TLS configuration.

The Kubernetes Gateway API is new implementation of the ingress, load
balancing and service mesh API's. See
https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/[upstream^] for more information.

Also the https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.19/html/ingress_and_load_balancing/configuring-ingress-cluster-traffic#nw-ingress-gateway-api-overview_ingress-gateway-api[OpenShift documentation^] provides an overview of the Gateway API and it's integration.

We demonstrate how to add TLS to our Nginx deployment, how to
implement a shared Gateway and finally how to implement HTTP to HTTPS
redirection with the Gateway API. Furthermore we cover how _HTTPRoute_
objects attach to Gateways and dive into ordering of _HTTPRoute_
objects.

== Adding TLS to our Nginx deployment

In our fist post we simply exposed a Nginx web server via the
Gateway API. We only enabled HTTP, so let's try to do the same with
HTTPS now.

Remember we use a DNS wildcard domain `*.gtw.ocp.lan.stderr.at` which
points to our Gateway. The gateway is exposed via a _Service_ of type
_LoadBalancer_. We use
https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.19/html/networking_operators/metallb-operator[MetalLB]
for this.

The first step is setting up a wildcard TLS certificate for our custom
domain _*.gtw.ocp.lan.stderr.at_. We are using
https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa[EasyRSA] here, but use whatever tool you like.

Just for reference this is how we created a wildcard cert with EasyRSA:

[source,console]
----------
$ EASYRSA_CERT_EXPIRE=3650 EASYRSA_EXTRA_EXTS="subjectAltName=DNS:*.gtw.ocp.lan.stderr.at" ./easyrsa gen-req gtw.ocp.lan.stderr.at
$ EASYRSA_CERT_EXPIRE=3650 ./easyrsa sign-req serverClient gtw.ocp.lan.stderr.at
----------

EasyRSA stores the public key under _pki/issued_ and the private key
under _pki/private_. We copied the certificate and the private key to
a temporary directory.

Next we need to remove the private key passphrase and create a
Kubernetes secret from the private and pubic key:

[source,console]
----------
$ openssl rsa -in gtw.ocp.lan.stderr.at.key -out gtw.ocp.lan.stderr.at-insecure.key
$ oc create secret -n openshift-ingress tls gateway-api --cert=gtw.ocp.lan.stderr.at.crt --key=gtw.ocp.lan.stderr.at-insecure.key
----------

Now it's time to add a TLS listener to our _Gateway_ resource in the
_openshift-ingress_ namespace. Remember for the OpenShift Gateway API implementation, _Gateways_ have
to be deployed in the _openshift-ingress_ namespace.

[source,yaml]
----------
---
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: http-gateway
  namespace: openshift-ingress
spec:
  gatewayClassName: openshift-default
  listeners:
  - name: http
    protocol: HTTP
    port: 80
    hostname: "*.gtw.ocp.lan.stderr.at"
  - name: https
    protocol: HTTPS <1>
    port: 443 <2>
    hostname: "*.gtw.ocp.lan.stderr.at" <3>
    tls:
      mode: Terminate <4>
      certificateRefs:
        - name: gateway-api <5>
    allowedRoutes: <6>
      namespaces:
        from: All

----------
<1> We want to support HTTPS
<2> We use the default HTTPS port 443
<3> The URLs we support with this listener are the same as for HTTP
<4> We use edge termination for now, this means HTTP traffic will only be encrypted up to the gateway. From the gateway to our pod we speak plain HTTP.
<5> This is the name of the TLS secret we created above
<6> We accept routes from all namespaces

NOTE: Also remember from our first post that we created a
_ReferenceGrant_ in the namespace where Nginx is running. Otherwise
HTTP routes will not be accepted.

Finally lets try to access our Nginx pod via HTTPS:

[source,console]
----------

(output omitted)
----------

Yes, we can reach our Nginx via HTTPS, and the gateway presents the TLS certificate we created.

NOTE: Be aware that we are still using the same _HTTPRoute_ for Nginx from our previous blog post.

Just for completeness here is the _HTTPRoute_:

[source,yaml]
----------
---
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: nginx-route
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: http-gateway
    namespace: openshift-ingress
  hostnames: ["nginx.gtw.ocp.lan.stderr.at"]
  rules:
  - backendRefs:
    - name: nginx
      namespace: gateway-api-test
      port: 8080
----------

NOTE: Also Remember that we are using a dedicated _Gateway_ and all
_HTTPRoutes_ must be in the namespace _openshift-ingress_

== Moving to a shared gateway

Up until now we had to create all _HTTPRoute_ objects in the
_openshift-ingress_ namespace. The Gateway API support two modes of
operations:

* Dedicated gateway: all _HTTPRoute_ object need to be in the same namespace as the gateway
* Shared gateway: The gateway runs in the _openshift-ingress_
  namespace and we allow _HTTPRoute_ objects from all or specific namespaces.

The first step in creating a shared gateway is to modify the gateway resource:

[source,yaml]
----------
---
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: http-gateway
  namespace: openshift-ingress
spec:
  gatewayClassName: openshift-default
  listeners:
  - name: http
    protocol: HTTP
    port: 80
    hostname: "*.gtw.ocp.lan.stderr.at"
    allowedRoutes: <1>
      namespaces:
        from: All
----------
<1> We now allow _HTTPRoute_ objects from all namespaces in the cluster

Next we delete the existing _HTTPRoute_ for Nginx in the
_openshift-ingress_ namespaces, and verify that we can't reach Nginx:

[source,console]
----------
$  oc delete httproutes.gateway.networking.k8s.io -n openshift-ingress nginx-route
httproute.gateway.networking.k8s.io "nginx-route" deleted
$ curl -I http://nginx.gtw.ocp.lan.stderr.at
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found <1>
date: Sat, 30 Aug 2025 15:02:23 GMT
transfer-encoding: chunked
----------
<1> Our Nginx route stopped working

Next we apply our modified _Gateway_ resource in the
_openshift-ingress_ namespace and the _HTTPRoute_ object in the
_gateway-api-test_ namespace.

[source,console]
----------
$ oc apply -n openshift-ingress -f gateway--selector.yaml
gateway.gateway.networking.k8s.io/http-gateway configured
$ oc apply -n gateway-api-test -f httproute.yaml <1>
httproute.gateway.networking.k8s.io/nginx-route created
$ curl -I http://nginx.gtw.ocp.lan.stderr.at
HTTP/1.1 200 OK <2>
server: nginx/1.29.1
date: Sat, 30 Aug 2025 15:04:34 GMT
content-type: text/html
content-length: 615
last-modified: Wed, 13 Aug 2025 14:33:41 GMT
etag: "689ca245-267"
accept-ranges: bytes
----------
<1> We create the _HTTPRoute_ in the gateway-api-test namespace
<2> We can reach our Nginx pod again

So our shared gateway seems to be working. But what if we want to
restrict which namespaces are allowed to create route objects?

The Gateway API allows the following settings under _spec.listeners[].allowedRoutes.namespaces.from_ field

* *All*: Allow from all namespaces
* *Selector*: Specify a selector
* *Same*: Only allow _HTTPRoutes_ in the same namespaces
* *None*: Do not allow any routes to attach

See the API specification https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/reference/spec/#fromnamespaces[FromNamespaces] for details.

Let's try to use a more specific selector for our gateway:

[source,yaml]
----------
---
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: http-gateway
  namespace: openshift-ingress
spec:
  gatewayClassName: openshift-default
  listeners:
  - name: http
    protocol: HTTP
    port: 80
    hostname: "*.gtw.ocp.lan.stderr.at"
    allowedRoutes:
      namespaces:
        from: Selector <1>
        selector:
          matchLabels:
            kubernetes.io/metadata.name: gateway-api-test <2>
----------
<1> Now we are using the Selector option
<2> Because we do not have a specific label on the namespace we would like to use, let's use the _metadata.name_ label Kubernetes created for us

We create a new yaml file _gateway-selector.yaml_ and appy the new configuration:

[source,console]
----------
$ oc apply -n openshift-ingress -f gateway-selector.yaml
gateway.gateway.networking.k8s.io/http-gateway configured
$ curl -I http://nginx.gtw.ocp.lan.stderr.at
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
server: nginx/1.29.1
date: Sat, 30 Aug 2025 15:17:17 GMT
content-type: text/html
content-length: 615
last-modified: Wed, 13 Aug 2025 14:33:41 GMT
etag: "689ca245-267"
accept-ranges: bytes
----------

All good, still working.

NOTE: Just for testing we modified the namespace name in the Gateway definition to *NOT* match the namespace of our Nginx deployment and confirmed that we receive a _404_ not found response.

== Implementing HTTP to HTTPS redirect

As a last test for this post let's try to implement HTTP to HTTPS redirects.

We deployed the following _Gateway_ configuration:

[#Gateway configuration]
[source,yaml]
----------
---
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: http-gateway
  namespace: openshift-ingress <1>
spec:
  gatewayClassName: openshift-default
  listeners:
  - name: http
    protocol: HTTP
    port: 80
    hostname: "*.gtw.ocp.lan.stderr.at"
    allowedRoutes:
      namespaces:
        from: Selector
        selector:
          matchLabels:
            kubernetes.io/metadata.name: gateway-api-test2
  - name: https <2>
    protocol: HTTPS
    port: 443
    hostname: "*.gtw.ocp.lan.stderr.at"
    tls:
      mode: Terminate
      certificateRefs:
        - name: gateway-api
    allowedRoutes:
      namespaces:
        from: All
----------
<1> Always deploy the gateway to the _openshift-ingress_ namespace for the OpenShift Gateway API implementation
<2> We added the HTTPS configuration back

The https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/http-redirect-rewrite/[upstream] documentation contains an example on how to implements HTTP to HTTPS redirects. We created the following additional _HTTPRoute_ object in the _gateway-api-test_ namespace:

[source,yaml]
----------
---
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: http-https-redirect
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: http-gateway <1>
    namespace: openshift-ingress
    sectionName: http <2>
  hostnames:
  - nginx.gtw.ocp.lan.stderr.at
  rules:
  - filters:
    - type: RequestRedirect
      requestRedirect:
        scheme: https
        statusCode: 301
----------
<1> Match our _Gateway_ _http-gateway_
<2> Match the _http_ section in our gateway

Just for reference this is the _HTTPRoute_ object to expose Nginx:

[source,yaml]
----------
---
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: nginx-route
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: http-gateway
    namespace: openshift-ingress
  hostnames: ["nginx.gtw.ocp.lan.stderr.at"]
  rules:
  - backendRefs:
    - name: nginx
      namespace: gateway-api-test
      port: 8080
----------

First we re-applied our _Gateway_ configuration

[source,console]
----------
$ oc apply -f gateway-https-selector.yaml
gateway.gateway.networking.k8s.io/http-gateway configured
----------

Let's try and verify if our redirect is working, we need to apply both routes:

[source,console]
----------
$ oc apply -f httproute.yaml
httproute.gateway.networking.k8s.io/nginx-route created
$ oc apply -f http-https-redirect-route.yaml
httproute.gateway.networking.k8s.io/http-https-redirect created
----------

And test with curl:

[source,console]
----------
$ curl -I http://nginx.gtw.ocp.lan.stderr.at
HTTP/1.1 200 OK <1>
server: nginx/1.29.1
date: Sat, 30 Aug 2025 15:37:20 GMT
content-type: text/html
content-length: 615
last-modified: Wed, 13 Aug 2025 14:33:41 GMT
etag: "689ca245-267"
accept-ranges: bytes
----------
<1> Hm, strange we still get 200 OK and *NOT* a redirect to HTTPS

=== Understanding HTTPRoute ordering

After a longer search through the documentation we found some hints on why this is happening.

Let's take a more detailed look at our http-to-https route again, as a
_HTTPRoute_ *attaches* to a _Gateway_, we focus on the _parentRefs_ in
the _HTTPRoute_ object. In our current understanding _parentRefs_ select a _Gateway_:

[source,yaml]
----------
---
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: http-https-redirect
spec:
  parentRefs: <1>
  - name: http-gateway <2>
    namespace: openshift-ingress <3>
    sectionName: http <4>
  hostnames:
  - nginx.gtw.ocp.lan.stderr.at
  rules:
  - filters:
    - type: RequestRedirect
      requestRedirect:
        scheme: https
        statusCode: 301

----------
<1> Ok, this is the _parentRefs_ section we are looking for
<2> _name_ selects the name of the _Gateway_ we want to attach to
<3> _namespace_ specifies the namespace where we can find the _Gateway_
<4> _sectionName_ selects the section in the _Gateway_ where we want to attach to.

So this _HTTPRoute_ explicitly attaches to a _Gateway_ in a
_Namespace_ that has a _Section_ http defined.

If you look at the Gateway configuration above you will see that we
have a section for HTTP traffic and one for HTTPS traffic.

Let's compare this with our Nginx _HTTPRoute_ definition:

[source,yaml]
----------
---
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: nginx-route
spec:
  parentRefs: <1>
  - name: http-gateway <2>
    namespace: openshift-ingress <3>
  hostnames: ["nginx.gtw.ocp.lan.stderr.at"]
  rules:
  - backendRefs:
    - name: nginx
      namespace: gateway-api-test
      port: 8080
----------
<1> The _parentRefs_ section
<2> The _Gateway_ we would like to attach to
<3> The _namespace_ where the _Gateway_ is deploy

Note that _Section_ is missing in this configuration.

So this _HTTPRoute_ actually attaches to *both* sections in our
_Gateway_ definition, HTTP and HTTPS. Which is not what we want.

* When a client hits the HTTP endpoint we want to redirect the traffic to HTTPS
* When a client hits the HTTPS endpoint we want the traffic to be forward to our Nginx deployment

We found the following statement
https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/reference/spec/#httprouterule[statement]
how ordering works in the Gateway API:

----
If ties still exist across multiple Routes, matching precedence MUST be
determined in order of the following criteria, continuing on ties:
The oldest Route based on creation timestamp.
----

When we look at the timestamps of our _HTTPRoutes_:

[source,console]
----------
oc get httproute -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\t"}{.metadata.creationTimestamp}{"\n"}{end}'
http-https-redirect     2025-08-31T09:17:46Z <1>
nginx-route     2025-08-31T09:17:40Z <2>
----------
<1> Creation timestamp of the redirect route
<2> Creation timestamp of the nginx route

The Nginx _HTTPRoute_ is *older* than the HTTP-to-HTTP _HTTPRoute_. So
this matches first and a 200 OK is returned.

So let's try to revers how we applied our _HTTPRoutes_:

[source,console]
----------
$ oc delete httproutes.gateway.networking.k8s.io --all
httproute.gateway.networking.k8s.io "http-https-redirect" deleted
httproute.gateway.networking.k8s.io "nginx-route" deleted

$ oc apply -f http-to-https-httproute.yaml
httproute.gateway.networking.k8s.io/http-https-redirect created
$ oc apply -f nginx-httproute.yaml
httproute.gateway.networking.k8s.io/nginx-route created

$ oc get httproute -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\t"}{.metadata.creationTimestamp}{"\n"}{end}'
http-https-redirect     2025-08-31T10:34:55Z <1>
nginx-route     2025-08-31T10:35:11Z <2>
----------
<1> Creation timestamp of the HTTP-to-HTTPS route
<2> Creation timestamp of the nginx route

Now the HTTP-to-HTTPS route is the oldest route. Let's try again calling Nginx with curl:

[source,console]
----------
$ curl -I http://nginx.gtw.ocp.lan.stderr.at
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently <1>
location: https://nginx.gtw.ocp.lan.stderr.at/
date: Sun, 31 Aug 2025 10:37:13 GMT
transfer-encoding: chunked

$ curl -I https://nginx.gtw.ocp.lan.stderr.at
HTTP/2 200 <2>
server: nginx/1.29.1
date: Sun, 31 Aug 2025 10:37:17 GMT
content-type: text/html
content-length: 615
last-modified: Wed, 13 Aug 2025 14:33:41 GMT
etag: "689ca245-267"
accept-ranges: bytes
----------
<1> The HTTP endpoint returns a redirect
<2> the HTTPS endpoint returns 200 OK from Nginx

So now we have the expected behavior: HTTP is redirect to HTTPS!

As depending on the time when an object is created is definitely *NOT*
a good idea, let's be more specific in our Nginx _HTTPRoute_:

[source,yaml]
----------
---
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: nginx-route
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: http-gateway
    namespace: openshift-ingress
    sectionName: https <1>
  hostnames: ["nginx.gtw.ocp.lan.stderr.at"]
  rules:
  - backendRefs:
    - name: nginx
      namespace: gateway-api-test
      port: 8080

----------
<1> We explicitly select the *HTTPS* section in our _Gateway_ configuration

Next we delete our _HTTPRoutes_ again, and re-apply them in the order that didn't work the first time (Nginx is the oldest route):

[source,console]
----------
$ oc delete httproutes.gateway.networking.k8s.io --all
httproute.gateway.networking.k8s.io "http-https-redirect" deleted
httproute.gateway.networking.k8s.io "nginx-route" deleted

$ oc apply -f http-to-https-httproute.yaml
httproute.gateway.networking.k8s.io/http-https-redirect created

$ oc get httproute -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\t"}{.metadata.creationTimestamp}{"\n"}{end}'
http-https-redirect     2025-08-31T10:45:01Z
nginx-route     2025-08-31T10:44:57Z <1>

$ curl -I http://nginx.gtw.ocp.lan.stderr.at
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently <2>
location: https://nginx.gtw.ocp.lan.stderr.at/
date: Sun, 31 Aug 2025 10:46:22 GMT
transfer-encoding: chunked

$ curl -I https://nginx.gtw.ocp.lan.stderr.at
HTTP/2 200 <3>
server: nginx/1.29.1
date: Sun, 31 Aug 2025 10:46:30 GMT
content-type: text/html
content-length: 615
last-modified: Wed, 13 Aug 2025 14:33:41 GMT
etag: "689ca245-267"
accept-ranges: bytes
----------
<1> The Nginx route is the oldest route
<2> The HTTP endpoint returns a redirect to HTTPS
<3> The response from our Nginx deployment

Finally everything works as expected!

NOTE: A _HTTPRoute_ attaches to a _Gateway_. Always be as specific as
possible which _Gateway_ to match and which _section_ in the
_Gateway_.


== Conclusion

In this blog post we demonstrated to implement TLS with the
Gateway API. We also implemented a shared _Gateway_ with _HTTPRoute_
objects in different namespaces.

Furthermore we configured HTTP to HTTPS redirects and dove into
_HTTPRoute_ ordering if a route matches multiple listeners in a
_Gateway_ definition.
