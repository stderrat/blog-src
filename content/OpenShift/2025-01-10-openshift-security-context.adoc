To improve overall container security OpenShift supports the following concepts

- Pod Security Standards (PSP), available in OpenShift and upstream Kubernetes
- Security Context Constraints (SCC), available only in OpenShift

In this blog post we try to clarify both concepts and explain how they
are related.

## Understanding OpenShift Security Context Constraints, Pod Security Standard/Profiles and Admission

Lets start with defining what "security context" means in
Kubernetes. Quoting the https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/[upstream documentation]:

[quote]
A security context defines privilege and access control settings for a Pod or Container.

In Openshift this translates to the following settings, once again
quoting the upstream Kubernetes documentation:

- Discretionary Access Control: Permission to access an object, like a
  file, is based on user ID (UID) and group ID (GID).
- Mandatory Access Control: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security-Enhanced_Linux][Security Enhanced Linux]] (SELinux)
- Running as privileged or unprivileged.
- Linux Capabilities: Give a process some privileges, but not all the
  privileges of the root user.
- Seccomp: Filter a process's system calls.
- allowPrivilegeEscalation: Controls whether a process can gain more
  privileges than its parent process.
- readOnlyRootFilesystem: Mounts the container's root filesystem as read-only.

Understanding Security Context Contraints and Pod Security Standards
can be difficult especially as in Openshift there is some kind of
automatic synchonization happening between those settings. (TODO)

Let's start with an overview of Pod Security Standard's which are also
available in upstream Kubernetes.

Also remember this is just a summary of those concepts and a desperate
try to provide a single page collecting all available
information. Always read the upstream OpenShift and Kubernetes
documentation for further details.


NOTE:

ANP and BANP are designed for cluster administrators to protect the entire cluster by creating **cluster-scoped policies**. They are not replacing NetworkPolicies,
but instead create a tier model and can be used together. Administrators can use ANPs to enforce non-overridable policies that take precedence over NetworkPolicy objects.
Administrators can use BANP to set up and enforce optional cluster-scoped network policy rules that are overridable by users using NetworkPolicy objects when necessary.
When used together, ANP, BANP, and network policy can achieve full multi-tenant isolation that administrators can use to secure their cluster.

The three resources create a 3-Tier Access Control List (ACL) that is evaluated in descending order:

* Tier 1 - AdminNetworkPolicy (ANP): If the traffic matches an **allow** or **deny** rule, then any existing
NetworkPolicy and BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy (BANP) objects in the cluster are skipped from evaluation. If a **pass** rule is matched, then the evaluation is handed over to
the next tier (NetworkPolicy). This means, that Cluster Administrators can enforce policies that cannot be overwritten by users (allow/deny rules) or pass the evaluation to the Network Policy,
where the project owners can decide further.

* Tier 2 - NetworkPolicy (NP): If the traffic passed the ANP then the NetworkPolicy is evaluating the traffic. The NetworkPolicy resources are controlled by the project owners by default.

* Tier 3 - BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy (BANP): If the traffic passed the ANP and the NetworkPolicy, then the BANP is evaluating the traffic.
These objects are controlled by the cluster administrators again and are cluster scoped. There can only be one BANP (named "default") configured on the cluster.

## AdminNetworkPolicy

An AdminNetworkPolicy (ANP) is a cluster-scoped resource, that allow cluster administrators to secure the network traffic **before** NetworkPolicies in the namespaces are evaluated.
These rules cannot be overwritten by project owners or developers and allow the administrators to enforce the security. Use cases could be, for example:

* You want to enforce only specific egress endpoints (e.g. only allow traffic to the specific database servers)
* You want to be sure that traffic from OpenShift monitoring is always allowed
* You want to allow the management of NetworkPolicies to project owners and do not want to take care for them or during the onboarding.

The ANP allows cluster administrators to define:

* A priority value that determines the order of its evaluation. The lower the value the higher the precedence.
* A set of pods that consists of a set of namespaces or namespace on which the policy is applied.
* A list of ingress rules to be applied for all ingress traffic towards the subject.
* A list of egress rules to be applied for all egress traffic from the subject.


## AdminNetworkPolicy Actions for Rules

The AdminNetworkPolicy allows three actions for the rules:

* *Allow*: The traffic is allowed, and no further rules are evaluated.
* *Deny*: The traffic is denied, and no further rules are evaluated.
* *Pass*: The traffic is passed to the next tier (NetworkPolicy).

## Subject of a Policy

In any ANP (or BANP) a **subject** can be defined and they specify the pods to which this AdminNetworkPolicy applies. (Note that host-networked pods are not included in subject.selection.) There are two ways to define the subject:

. *namespaces*: The namespaces block is used to select pods via namespace selectors. Here, *matchLabels* or *matchExpressions* can be used to limit the namespaces.
. *pods*: The Pods-Array is used to select pods via namespace AND pod selectors. Here *namespaceSelector* and *podSelector* can be set to limit the Pods.

If **subject** is not defined, the policy applies to all pods and namespaces in the cluster.

In my Helm chart the options are supported like the following snippets show:

### Select Namespaces with matchExpressions

Values in the Helm Chart:

[source,yaml]
----
anp:
  - name: sample-anp-rule-1
    enabled: true
    priority: 50

    subject:
      matchNamespaces: <1>
        matchExpressions: <2>
          - key: kubernetes.io/metadata.name
            operator: NotIn
            values:
              - kube-system
              - openshift*
              - default
              - kubde-info
----
<1> matchNamespaces is used to select namespaces
<2> matchExpressions is used to select namespaces with *matchExpressions*. In this example all namespaces that do not match (operator == NotIn) the values, so all namespaces except "kube-system, kube-info, default and openshift*" are selected.

This will result in the following AdminNetworkPolicy snippet:

[source,yaml]
----
  subject:
    namespaces:
      matchExpressions:
        - key: kubernetes.io/metadata.name
          operator: NotIn
          values:
            - "kube-system"
            - "openshift*"
            - "default"
            - "kubde-info"
----

### Select Namespaces with matchLabels

Values in the Helm Chart:

[source,yaml]
----
anp:
  - name: sample-anp-rule-1
    enabled: true
    priority: 5

    subject:
      matchNamespaces: <1>
        matchLabels: <2>
          apps: my-apps
          tenant: my-tenant
----
<1> matchNamespaces is used to select namespaces
<2> *matchLabels* is used to select namespaces based on labels. In this example, all namespaces that have the labels "apps: my-apps" and "tenant: my-tenant" are selected.

This will result in the following AdminNetworkPolicy snippet:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  priority: 5
  subject:
    namespaces:
      matchLabels:
        apps: "my-apps"
        tenant: "my-tenant"
----

### Select Pods with podSelectors and namespaceSelectors

Values in the Helm Chart:

[source,yaml]
----
anp:
  - name: sample-anp-rule-1
    enabled: true
    priority: 5

    subject:
      matchPods:
        - pods: <1>
            namespaceSelector: <2>
              labels:
                kubernetes.io/metadata.name: openshift-dns
            podSelector: <3>
              labels:
                app: dns
----
<1> matchPods is used to select pods. Here a list of pods can be defined.
<2> *namespaceSelector* is used to select namespaces based on labels. In this example all namespaces that have the label "kubernetes.io/metadata.name: openshift-dns" are selected.
<3> *podSelector* is used to select pods based on labels. In this example all pods that have the label "app: dns" are selected.

This will result in the following AdminNetworkPolicy snippet:

[source,yaml]
----
  subject:
    - pods:
        namespaceSelector:
          matchLabels:
            kubernetes.io/metadata.name: openshift-dns
        podSelector:
          matchLabels:
            app: dns
----

## BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy

BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy (BANP) is a cluster-scoped resource, that allow cluster administrators to secure the network traffic **after** NetworkPolicies in the namespaces have been evaluated. These rules can be overwritten by project owners or developers using NetworkPolicies.

CAUTION: BANP is a singleton resource, meaning it can be defined only one time. Therefore, its name must be **default**. Moreover, the **priority** field is not required here.

Use cases could be, for example:

* Creating default rules, such as blocking any intra-cluster traffic by default. Users will need to explicitly use NetworkPolicy objects to allow known traffic.

A BANP allows administrators to specify:

* A subject that consists of a set of namespaces or namespace.
* A list of ingress rules to be applied for all ingress traffic towards the subject.
* A list of egress rules to be applied for all egress traffic from the subject.

## BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy Actions for Rules

The BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy allows two actions for the rules. They are like the AdminNetworkPolicy, except for the **pass** action, which does not make sense here as BANP is the last tier (nowhere to pass).

* *Allow*: The traffic is allowed, and no further rules are evaluated.
* *Deny*: The traffic is denied, and no further rules are evaluated.

## Examples Examples Examples

The following examples are taken directly from https://network-policy-api.sigs.k8s.io/blog/2024/01/30/getting-started-with-the-adminnetworkpolicy-api/[Kubernetes Blog: Getting started with the AdminNetworkPolicy API^] and https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/networking/network_security/network-policy-apis.html[Official OpenShift Documentation^]. Verify the values-file of the https://github.com/tjungbauer/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/admin-networkpolicies[Helm Chart^] for the further examples.

WARNING: I will show, how to configure them using the Helm Chart https://github.com/tjungbauer/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/admin-networkpolicies[admin-networkpolicies^] and the actual result. The chart is already configured with these examples and prepared to be used with GitOps/Argo CD.

### Example 1: Allow all traffic from the OpenShift monitoring namespace

Typically, it makes sense to allow the traffic from OpenShift Monitoring to all namespaces. After all, monitoring is useful :)
The following example shows the possible configuration for the Helm Chart, which will render a valid ANP resource for us. It will allow ALL (including OpenShift internal Namespaces) traffic from the OpenShift monitoring namespace (labeled as `kubernetes.io/metadata.name: monitoring`).

[source,yaml]
----
---
anp:
  - name: sample-anp-rule-1 <1>
    enabled: true <2>
    syncwave: 10
    priority: 5 <3>

    subject: {} <4>
    ingress: <5>
      - name: allow-ingress-from-monitoring <6>
        enabled: true <7>
        action: Allow <8>
        peers: <9>
          - type: namespaces
            labels:
              kubernetes.io/metadata.name: monitoring
----
<1> Name of the ANP
<2> Enable or disable the ANP. If disabled, the ANP will not be created. (Default is `false`)
<3> Priority of the ANP. The lower the value the higher the precedence. (Default is `50`)
<4> Subject of the ANP. In this case, it is empty, which means all namespaces including OpenShift internal namespaces.
<5> Ingress rules of the ANP. Here a list of ingress rules for this ANP can be defined
<6> Name of the ingress rule
<7> Enable or disable the ingress rule. If disabled, the particular ingress rule will not be created. (Default is `false`)
<8> Action of the ingress rule. In this case, it is `Allow`, which means all traffic from the OpenShift monitoring namespace will be allowed. Other options are described at <<AdminNetworkPolicy Actions for Rules>>.
<9> Peers of the ingress rule. In this case, all namespaces labeled as `kubernetes.io/metadata.name: monitoring` are allowed to access all namespaces.

The ANP that will be created is the following. It is a valid ANP resource and can be applied to the cluster. (Typically applied by Argo CD)
As described above it will allow incoming access from the OpenShift monitoring namespace to all namespaces.

[source,yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: policy.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: AdminNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: "sample-anp-rule-1"
  labels:
    helm.sh/chart: admin-networkpolicies-1.0.2
    app.kubernetes.io/name: admin-networkpolicies
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: release-name
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: Helm
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave: "10"
    argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: SkipDryRunOnMissingResource=true
spec:
  priority: 5
  subject:
    namespaces: {}
  ingress:
    - name: "allow-ingress-from-monitoring"
      action: "Allow"
      from:
      - namespaces:
          matchLabels:
            kubernetes.io/metadata.name: "monitoring"
----

### Example 2: Allow all traffic from labeled namespaces

As a second example, we want to allow all traffic from namespaces that are labeled with `tenant: restricted` to all namespaces that are labeled with `anp: cluster-control-anp`.
This is useful, if you want to restrict access to certain namespaces. However, the rule action is configured as **Pass** which means that the traffic will be allowed but might be further restricted by a NetworkPolicy in the tenant namespace.

[source,yaml]
----
---
anp:
  - name: sample-anp-rule-2
    enabled: true
    priority: 5

    subject:
      matchNamespaces: <1>
        matchLabels:
          anp: cluster-control-anp <2>

    ingress:
      - name: pass-from-restricted-tenants
        enabled: true
        action: Pass <3>
        peers:
          - type: namespaces <4>
            labels:
              tenant: restricted
----
<1> Subject of the ANP. In this case, we select based on labels.
<2> Label selector for the namespaces. In this case, all namespaces that are labeled with `anp: cluster-control-anp` are subject of this ANP.
<3> Action of the ingress rule. In this case, it is `Pass`, which means the traffic is allowed, but might be restricted by NetworkPolicies in the tenant namespace. Other options are described at <<AdminNetworkPolicy Actions for Rules>>.
<4> Peers of the ingress rule. In this case, all namespaces labeled as `tenant: restricted` are allowed to access all namespaces.

[source,yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: policy.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: AdminNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: "sample-anp-rule-2"
  labels:
    helm.sh/chart: admin-networkpolicies-1.0.2
    app.kubernetes.io/name: admin-networkpolicies
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: release-name
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: Helm
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave: "10"
    argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: SkipDryRunOnMissingResource=true
spec:
  priority: 5
  subject:
    namespaces:
      matchLabels:
        anp: "cluster-control-anp"
  ingress:
    - name: "pass-from-restricted-tenants"
      action: "Pass"
      from:
      - namespaces:
          matchLabels:
            tenant: "restricted"
----

### Example 3: Show possible peers settings

The most important settings for the rules are the `peers` settings. The following examples show the snippets of possible peers.
For further information, please refer to the example in the values file: https://github.com/tjungbauer/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/admin-networkpolicies/values.yaml[Helm Chart Values with further examples^]

NOTE: The following rules are examples of **EGRESS** rules.

. Allow egress traffic *to namespaces labeled* splunk on ports 80 and 443:

[source,yaml]
----
        peers:
          - type: namespaces
            labels:
              tenant: splunk
        ports:
          - protocol: TCP
            portNumber: 80
          - portName: https
----

[start=2]
. Allow egress traffic *to nodes* where the key "node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane" exists *on the port 6443*:

[source,yaml]
----
        peers:
          - type: nodes
            expr:
              - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane
                operator: Exists
        ports:
          - protocol: TCP
            portNumber: 6443
----

[start=3]
. Allow egress traffic *to pods* labeled "app: dns" *in the namespace* openshift-dns *on the port 53 and 5353*:

[source,yaml]
----
        peers:
          - type: pods
            namespaceSelector:
              matchLabels:
                kubernetes.io/metadata.name: openshift-dns
            podSelector:
              matchLabels:
                app: dns

        ports:
          - protocol: TCP
            port: 5353
          - protocol: TCP
            port: 53
          - protocol: UDP
            port: 53
          - protocol: UDP
            port: 5353
----

[start=4]
. Allow egress traffic *to a list of IPs*:

[source,yaml]
----
        peers:
          - type: networks
            ips:
              - 172.29.0.0/30
              - 10.0.54.0/19
              - 10.0.56.38/32
              - 10.0.69.0/24
----

[start=5]
. Allows egress traffic *to a list of domain names* (*.kubernetes.io and kubernetes.io)

[source,yaml]
----
        peers:
          - type: domainNames
            domains:
              - '*.kubernetes.io'
              - kubernetes.io
----

[start=6]
. *Deny all egress traffic*. This should be the last rule when full egress traffic shall be disabled. This might also be put into the BANP.

[source,yaml]
----
      - name: default-deny
        enabled: true
        action: Deny
        peers:
          - type: networks
            ips:
              - 0.0.0.0/0
----

### Example 4: BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy

The BANP is more or less identical to ANP, except that you cannot define a "name" and a "priority". The following example creates a BANP that allows incoming and outgoing traffic to namespaces labeled "tenant-1".

[source,yaml]
----
banp: <1>
  - enabled: true <2>
    syncwave: 10

    subject:
      matchNamespaces:
        matchLabels:
          kubernetes.io/metadata.name: example.name

    ingress:
      - name: "deny-all-ingress-from-tenant-1"
        enabled: true
        action: Deny
        peers:
          - type: pods
            namespaceSelector:
              matchLabels:
                custom-banp: tenant-1

            podSelector:
              matchLabels:
                custom-banp: tenant-1

    egress:
      - name: allow-all-egress-to-tenant-1
        enabled: true
        action: Allow
        peers:
          - type: pods
            namespaceSelector:
              matchLabels:
                custom-banp: tenant-1

            podSelector:
              matchLabels:
                custom-banp: tenant-1
----
<1> Using the key *banp* (instead of *anp*)
<2> No *name* or *priority* are defined here.
