Lately I came across several issues where a given Helm Chart must be modified after it has been rendered by Argo CD.  
Argo CD does a *helm template* to render a Chart. Sometimes, especially when you work with Subcharts or when a specific setting is not yet supported by the Chart, you need to modify it later ... you need to post-render the Chart. 
 
In this very short article, I would like to demonstrate this on a real-live example I had to do. I would like to inject annotations to a Route objects, so that the certificate can be injected. This is done by the cert-utils operator. 
For the post-rendering the Argo CD repo pod will be extended with a sidecar container, that is watching for the repos and patches them if required.

WARNING: Everything below is using OpenShift Gitops Operator. This is based on Argo CD, but instead of directly modifying the repo Deployment, we will modify the Argo CD Custom Resource. 

NOTE: In the future it will be easier to inject certificates into a Route, by defining a Secret. This as currently a TechPreview feature (OpenShift 4.17). https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.17/networking/routes/secured-routes.html#nw-ingress-route-secret-load-external-cert_secured-routes[Creating a route with externally managed certificate
^]

== The Route Object

Imagine we have the following Route object, rendered via Helm template:  

[source,yaml]
----
--- 
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1 
kind: Route 
metadata: 
  name: my-route 
  namespace: my-namespace 
spec: 
  host: my.route.apps.cluster.name 
  port: 
    targetPort: http 
  tls: 
    insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: Redirect 
    termination: edge 
  to: 
    kind: Service 
    name: my-service 
    weight: 100 
  wildcardPolicy: None 
----

The cert-manager Operator requested a certificate which can be found in the Secret "my-certificate ".  
To let the cert-utils Operator inject the data from the certificate automatically, we need to add annotations to that Route object.  

This injection is usually a good idea, since we do not want to define certificate and (private) key directly in the Route object using our Chart. 

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1 
kind: Route 
metadata: 
  annotations: 
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: my-issuer 
    cert-utils-operator.redhat-cop.io/certs-from-secret: my-certificate 
----

NOTE: In this example certificates have to be ordered. No wildcard certificate is available.

== Post-Rendering

To modify the output after it has been rendered by Argo CD we will use *Kustomize patch feature*. This means, after the template has been rendered, we send it to Kustomize and let it patch it. 
 
Let's go through the steps one-by-one:  

. Create a kustomization.yaml
Place the following file next to your Chart.yaml  

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1 
kind: Kustomization 
namespace: my-namespace 
 
resources: 
  - ./all.yaml 
 
patches: 
  - patch: | 
      - op: add 
        path: /metadata/annotations 
        value: 
          cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: my-issuer 
          cert-utils-operator.redhat-cop.io/certs-from-secret: my-certificate 
    target: 
      kind: Route 
      name: my-route 
----

This will patch the Route object. You can test this locally by execute the command:
*helm template . > all.yaml && kustomize build && rm all.yaml* 

[start=2]
. Create an empty file called *my-cmp-plugin* into the folder next to the Chart.yaml  
I will explain in a bit why I chose to use this approach.  
 
. Create the following ConfigMap in the OpenShift GitOps namespace (for example openshift-gitops) 

[source,yaml]
----
kind: ConfigMap 
apiVersion: v1 
metadata: 
  name: my-cmp-plugin 
  namespace: openshift-gitops 
data: 
  plugin.yaml: |- 
    apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1 
    kind: ConfigManagementPlugin 
    metadata: 
      name: my-cmp-plugin 
    spec: 
      version: v1.0 
      init: 
        command: [sh, -c, 'echo "Initializing my-plugin-cmp..."', 'helm dependency build || true'] 
      generate: 
        command: [sh, -c, "helm template . --name-template $ARGOCD_APP_NAME --namespace $ARGOCD_APP_NAMESPACE --include-crds > all.yaml && kustomize build"] 
      discover: 
        find: 
          glob: "**/my-cmp-plugin" 
----

This will execute the command to generate a helm template, pipe the output into all.yaml and let Kustomize patch the output.  
The "discovery" part is looking for a specific file in the repository. I thought this might be useful to pin down this plugin to specific repositories only.  
However, there are other ways to implement this. You could omit this part and define the name of the plugin inside the Argo CD Application too for example.  

[start=4]
. Patching Argo CD Repo server

Now it is time to patch our repo server specification of the Argo CD custom resource.  
The following should do it: 
 
NOTE: As image for the sidecar container, I am using https://quay.io/repository/gnunn/tools[Gerald Nunn's^] tool image. You can use your own image, as long as Helm and Kustomize are available. 

[source,yaml]
---- 
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1 
kind: ArgoCD 
metadata: 
  name: openshift-gitops 
  namespace: openshift-gitops 
spec: 
[...] 
  repo: 
    - configMap: 
        name: my-cmp-plugin 
      name: my-cmp-plugin 
    sidecarContainers: 
      - name: my-cmp-plugin 
        command: [/var/run/argocd/argocd-cmp-server] 
        env: 
          - name: APP_ENV 
            value: prod 
        image: quay.io/gnunn/tools:latest 
        imagePullPolicy: Always 
        securityContext: 
          runAsNonRoot: true 
        volumeMounts: 
          - mountPath: /var/run/argocd 
            name: var-files 
          - mountPath: /home/argocd/cmp-server/plugins 
            name: plugins 
          - mountPath: /tmp 
            name: tmp 
          - mountPath: /home/argocd/cmp-server/config/plugin.yaml 
            subPath: plugin.yaml 
            name: my-cmp-plugin 
----

As soon as the repo Pod has been patched a 2nd container inside the Pod will be started as a sidecar. This will take the ConfigMap that was created in step 2 and mount it. As soon as a repo is found where this patch shall be executed, Argo CD will perform the actions defined in the ConfigMap, resulting in the output of the helm template and the patched output of Kustomize.

[source,yaml]
----
--- 
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1 
kind: Route 
metadata: 
  name: my-route 
  namespace: my-namespace 
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: my-issuer 
    cert-utils-operator.redhat-cop.io/certs-from-secret: my-certificate 
spec: 
  host: my.route.apps.cluster.name 
  port: 
    targetPort: http 
  tls: 
    insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: Redirect 
    termination: edge 
  to: 
    kind: Service 
    name: my-service 
    weight: 100 
  wildcardPolicy: None 
----

This is it; this will patch our resource. Such post-renderer can be used for other patches as well. For example, to remove certain items from an object.  

== 2nd Example
In my real-live example I had the problem that the *path* was empty in the Helm Chart and OpenShift automatically removed that, which was shown as out-of-sync in Argo CD. 
 
So I am using the patch to remove the path.  
 
CAUTION: Only do this if you are sure the element is really empty! 
 
I extended the kustomization.yaml with  

[source,yaml]
----
      - op: remove 
        path: /spec/path 
----

so it looks like: 

[source,yaml]
---- 
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1 
kind: Kustomization 
namespace: my-namespace 
 
resources: 
  - ./all.yaml 
 
patches: 
  - patch: | 
      - op: add 
        path: /metadata/annotations 
        value: 
          cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: my-issuer 
          cert-utils-operator.redhat-cop.io/certs-from-secret: my-certificate 
      - op: remove 
        path: /spec/path 
    target: 
      kind: Route 
      name: my-route 
----

This 2nd patch will completely remove the /spec/path from the Route object named _my-route_.
